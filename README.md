## Why Use Eye Blink Reminder?

When working at a computer, people tend to blink less frequently, which can lead to dry eyes and eye strain. The 20-20-20 rule is recommended by eye care professionals:
- Every 20 minutes
- Look at something 20 feet away
- For at least 20 seconds

This application helps you follow this rule by reminding you to blink regularly.
